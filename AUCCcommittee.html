		<h2>Captain: Jack Brickell<h2>

		<p>Jack Brickell is a spectacularly fluffy individual who secured the post of Captain by means of an alcohol 
		induced promise to eat a pine cone. He’s a hairy hipster who came to us from a background of sprint kayaking 
		and is therefore full of stylish moves despite often looking like the most scared individual on the river. 
		Off the water, you might find Jack gallivanting in Invergarry with various ‘big deals’, nurturing his love 
		affair for Canada, hipstering it up at a gig in suitably loud clothing or running around in the wild looking 
		at rocks- always with an arsenal of sarcastic replies and quotes from various obscure films. Although this 
		year it is more likely that his time will be consumed encouraging and babysitting the liability that is AUCC.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="Vice-Captain" class="col-sm-6">
   		<h2>Vice-Captain: Kitty Birley<h2>
				
		<p>She’s AUCC offspring so kayaking literally runs in her blood. You can tell this due to the big grin on her 
		face when she comes out of a horrible swim; even those that meant she got the prestigious swim of the year! 
		It’s hard for her enthusiasm not to rub off on you. Whether it be on the river or while drinking, Kitty is 
		there to support us and show us how it’s done. This includes but is not limited to pushing people into a 
		frozen canal to get the ball in polo or getting kicked out of a bar while leading confused freshers around 
		Aberdeen. She’s the one you can blame for the fabulousness of Fresher’s weekend and the one you can thank for 
		keeping you smiling when it’s not quite going your way. All that and an extra sprinkle of weirdness will make her 
		a great Vice Captain.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
   <div class="row">
      <div id="Treasurer" class="col-sm-6">
		<h2>Treasurer: Mitchell Roper<h2>

		<p>Mitchell Roper is our resident Canadian eh! His hair is long and his heart is big. He loves nothing 
		more than throwing himself down the mighty rivers of Scotland, usually upside down, and can often be spotted 
		in Tunnels with a suspicious glint in his eye. Mitchell is not only handsome but he is in charge of our money 
		and is a medic! A lot of responsibility for the real life Trailer Park Boy but you can be sure he’ll give you 
		a good deal on any trips!</p>
      </div>

      <div id="Secretary" class="col-sm-6">
   		<h2>Secretary: Michaela Howett<h2>
				
		<p>Michaela joined the club a shy, innocent fresher with the alcohol tolerance of a 12 year old. Three years 
		later and it’s safe to say she hasn't lost her drinking ability, but her innocence? You can judge that for 
		yourself... A night out with Michaela always ends with a story, from strangers mistaking her spew for 
		bolognaise to climbing abandoned towers at 4am in the freezing cold, it will be entertaining whatever the 
		outcome! As our secretary she will be looking after our website as well as our blog - an ideal job for the 
		literary competence of an English student!</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
   <div id="Events Officer1" class="col-sm-6">
		<h2>Events Officer: Keira Lockie-Anrig<h2>

		<p>Keira, a goddess greater than mermaids or unicorns, was delivered to AUCC from a land of love, kindness and 
		all things hippy! No matter what, our lovely lady always has a beaming smile on her face (even when teamed with 
		bumps, cuts and blood!) and with her hardcore enthusiasm from the word go, it was inevitable that she would 
		become one of our events officers/ In her role you will see her kindly encouraging you to all of our epic 
		events and after pool socials, providing massive smiles on the river, drunk as a skunk and probably walking 
		around with no shoes on. However, she does come with one caution label, as she possesses similar traits to a venus fly trap which some of you may experience on our endless nights out!</p>
      </div>

      <div id="Events Officer2" class="col-sm-6">
   		<h2>Events Officer: Joe Schamp<h2>
				
		<p>Hailing from the country that has a terrible history when it comes to winning world wars, we are not really 
		sure how this oversized man-child came to the land of Aberdeen, but we are pretty stoked that he did. Holding 
		most of canoe club’s values to heart such as a general disregard for his own heath and well-being and an 
		overwhelming commitment to adventuring (don’t ask about his gap yahhh, but do ask about exploring elephants 
		sexually) it made sense that Joe be responsible for making sure that every event AUCC holds will leave you 
		wondering what happened.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
   <div class="row">
      <div id="Competition-Sec" class="col-sm-6">
		<h2>Competition Sec.: Penny Coles<h2>

		<p>Ace kayaker. Party animal. Cat lady in the making. These are just some of the ways to describe our 
		competition secretary. Penny is the person to go to for kayaking tips, monologues about her cat Frodo, as 
		well as any and all insane behaviour. Disclaimer - Penny Coles does not take responsibility for any arrests, 
		alcohol poisoning, or kayaking carnage that occurs as a result of her influence.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="SAD Officer" class="col-sm-6">
   		<h2>Safety and Development(SAD) Officer: Murray Gauld<h2>
				
		<p>How do I begin to explain Murray Gauld? Murray Gauld is flawless... He has a LOT of orange boating kit and a 
		JACKSON kayak. His cats are insured for $10,000 I hear he does bat surveys… In crack dens. His favourite thing is 
		fishing swimmers out of rivers. One time he met a girl in Uganda, and she told him he was pretty! One time a girl 
		punched him in the face and broke his nose… it was awesome.</p>
